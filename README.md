-Region, City, State, Postal Code

Analytical Approach
-Data Preparation: Impored the Superstore dataset into Tableau and performed data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and creating calculated fields for metrics like profit margin.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to gain a preliminary understanding of the dataset and identify key variables and potential areas of interest.
-Dashboard Creation: Developed multiple dashboards focusing on different analytical perspectives such as sales overview, regional analysis, and customer segmentation.
